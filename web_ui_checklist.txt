This is a list that can be a general guideline for web-page testing:
1.	Functionality testing:
	a.	Validation testing:
		-	check for a valid HTML use W3C validator: https://validator.w3.org/
	
	b.	Links/URL testing:
		-	internal links: links that linke the webpage internally.
			I.e. all 'Home Page' and 'About Us' instances
		-	external links: all references to external web pages
		-	email links: check that the local email client opens and email style is valid
		-	check for broken links/dead links
	
	c.	Web form testing:
		-	user input and forms tests. Input all data and submit it. Validate all inputs/choices.
		-	required fields and optional fields validations
	
	d.	Database testing:
		-	validate database that the website is accessing and populating
		-	validate that the webpage is able to handle the data processing
	
	e.	Cookies testing:
		-	testing cookies (persistant and non-persistent/session cookies) for:
			-	disabling
			-	corrupting
			-	encryption
			-	writing with different browsers
			-	selective rejecting
			-	access to cookies
			-	overuse
			-	testing with different settings.
				Testing should be done to check that website is 
				working with different cookie setting.
			-	categorize cookies seperately. 
				Cookies should not be kept in the same category
				as viruses, spam or spyware.
	f.	Error messeges testing:
		-	40x and 50x error messages
		
	g.	Client-side testing:
		-	check that any sensitive data is not stored in temporary internet files
		-	check that sensitive information is encrypted when appropriate

2.	Performance testing
	a.	Speed, scalability and stability under variety of load conditions
	b.	The main purpose is to find bottlenecks not defects
	
3. Web usability testing - black box / user POV testing:
	a.	Accessibility:
		-	site load time
		-	font size and spacing 
		-	use of flash  and addons
		-	use of 40x and 50x error pages
		
	b.	Identity:
		-	website/company logo placement
		-	tags, favicons and identifications, i.e. contact information
		
	c.	Navigation:

		-	AMD
		-	ARM
	d.	check the webpages in  various network configurations
	e.	check the webpages in various screen resolutions
		
5.	Web security testing:
	a.	Penetration testing:
		-	password cracking
		-	URL manipulasion and XSS
		-	SQL injections
	b.	access to information regarding the webpages and servers:
		-	is the server type and version hidden from direct view?
		-	should the folder structure and any files be directly accessible?
