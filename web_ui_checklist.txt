This is a list that can be a general guideline for web-page testing:
1. Functionality testing:
	a.	Validation testing:
		-	check for a valid HTML use W3C validator: https://validator.w3.org/
	
	b.	Links/URL testing:
		-	internal links: links that linke the webpage internally.
			I.e. all 'Home Page' and 'About Us' instances
		-	external links: all references to external web pages
		-	email links: check that the local email client opens and email style is valid
		-	check for broken links/dead links
	
	c.	Web form testing:
		-	user input and forms tests. Input all data and submit it. Validate all inputs/choices.
	
	d.	Database testing:
		-	validate database that the website is accessing and populating
		-	validate that the webpage is able to handle the data processing
		
	e. Cookies testing:
		-	testing cookies (persistant and non-persistent/session cookies) for:
			-	disabling
			-	corrupting
			-	encryption
			-	writing with different browsers
			-	selective rejecting
			-	access to cookies
			-	overuse
			-	testing with different settings.
				Testing should be done to check that website is 
				working with different cookie setting.
			-	categorize cookies seperately. 
				Cookies should not be kept in the same category
				as viruses, spam or spyware.
